# Survival-Analysis-for-Cancer-Patients
- Performed survival analysis on a tabular dataset combining clinical and genomic features.
- Focused on improving missing data imputation techniques for downstream survival prediction.
- Applied denoising autoencoder (DAE) for imputation and compared it with standard methods (mean, KNN, MICE, etc.).
- Simulated different types of missingness (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) across various missing rates.
- Evaluated the quality of imputations using reconstruction metrics (RMSE, MAE, accuracy for categoricals).
- Assessed how different imputation affect survival prediction
